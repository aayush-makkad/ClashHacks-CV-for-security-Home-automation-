Computer Cv for security with Home automation and RFID using android biometric scan


Using openCV and android it is able to make out if a person is carrying a weapon(cosco ball in this case) thereby,shutting down the entire house by locking mechanism (made using arduino).
All the control passes to android application authenticated only with the fingerprint of a registered user of that particular house/institutuion to unlock/lock house.

That application alone has the capablity to act as an RFID for entering homes. No more stress regarding losing keys or forgetting lock patttern/pins.
